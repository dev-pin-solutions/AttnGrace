Our products are sustainably sourced, designed and packaged, featuring cutting-edge innovation, and are proudly manufactured in 100% Carbon Neutral Certified facilities.</p>"

Women consistently report that skin irritation has disappeared, they’re getting fewer, if any, UTIs, and that our products enable them to get back to doing the things they love. </p><p>Because of bladder leaks, 56% of women are avoiding social events, 27% of us are getting less sleep, and a heartbreaking 50% of women are worried about laughing in public. Not to mention that 68% of women have never mentioned their leaks to their doctor.</p><p>These numbers matter because we matter. This is not an uncommon experience, but for ages, this condition has been shrouded in shame, silence and stigma.</p><p>We believe that radical empathy is crucial to finally putting women’s wellness first and innovating for women’s specific incontinence needs.

It is used in a variety of products including shampoos and conditioners, body washes and shower gels, facial cleansers, and hand soaps. It can also be found in cleaning products and some pharmaceutical/nutraceutical products. Soap bark is generally considered safe when used in cosmetic and cleaning products at appropriate concentrations. However, some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to it, leading to skin irritation or allergic reactions upon contact."
